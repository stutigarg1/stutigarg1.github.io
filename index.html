        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Stuti, a 3rd year Computer Science Engineering student at Mahindra University. I have deep interests in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am committed to exploring innovative solutions through these technologies. My passion extends beyond just coding; I love storytelling through crafting stories or Kathak. I aim to leverage machine learning to address social challenges, fostering solutions that positively impact communities and enhance quality of life.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>ðŸŒ¼ In June 2022, I embarked on a project aimed at improving aviation safety by addressing the mental stability of pilots through Verifying Mental Stability of Pilots using Encephalogram. I proposed a methodology that employs EEG tests to assess pilots' readiness for safe flight operations. This initiative seeks to minimize airplane mishaps attributed to mental instability by providing employers with insights to identify potential issues among pilots, classifying them as either fit to fly or in need of medical evaluation. Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in hypothesis formulation, research methodologies, and collaborative efforts.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ¼ Building on this foundation, in October 2023, I developed a Movie Recommender Engine that leverages machine learning techniques to personalize user experiences. This recommendation system predicts whether an eleventh movie, based on a user's watchlist of ten films, will resonate with their preferences. I curated comprehensive datasets that encompassed critical attributes such as release year, genre, IMDb rating, actors, and filming locations. By analyzing commonalities and differences among the listed movies, I applied advanced machine learning methods and generative AI models to discern user inclinations and movie characteristics. This project enhanced my skills in Python, data curation, and the application of generative AI.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ¼ In May 2024, I further expanded my machine learning knowledge by working on a project focused on patient analysis, utilizing Gradient Boosting and Random Forest classifiers. This initiative aimed to analyze patient data effectively, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions. By leveraging these powerful algorithms, I learned how to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, enhancing my skills in predictive modeling and data-driven decision-making.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ¼ Most recently, in June 2024, I focused on enhancing the visibility of a website through effective Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategies. Utilizing Squarespace site-level tools and on-page SEO best practices, I successfully optimized content and implemented local SEO techniques. This effort not only improved the site's searchability but also ensured consistent business information across various platforms. Key skills honed during this project include SEO fundamentals, local search optimization, and crafting engaging meta descriptions.</p>
        <p>ðŸŒ¼ Through these projects, I have developed a diverse skill set and cultivated a deep commitment to leveraging technology in innovative ways that benefit society. Each experience has fueled my passion for exploring new solutions and making a positive impact in the communities I serve.</p>
